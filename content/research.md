Research I have done and I'm currently doing. The focus is tools that could be used to help with deep learning models.

- ðŸš§ [Deltagonalshift](https://github.com/aminoa/deltagonalshift) <br>
Determining the diagonal of a dynamically changing matrix using only oracle matvecs. 

- [Application of Gaussian and Euclidean Cost Matrices to Matrix Rescaling Optimal Transport Algorithms](/ALMDS_Project.pdf) <br>
Re-analysis of Jason Curturi's algorithms on Sinkhorn and Greenkhorn, wrote two new Greenkhorn variations with alternate row selection schemes to test if it better suited gaussian and random cost matrices. Found row selection in Greenkhorn was not relevant to the runtime. Done for Algorithmic Machine Learning and Data Science class. Under Professor Musco and colab with Jacob.
